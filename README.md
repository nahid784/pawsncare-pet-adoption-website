# pawsncare-pet-adoption-website

Paws & Care is a Pet Adoption and Care platform built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP (backend). Developed for the CSE415 course, this project enables users to adopt pets, find pet care resources, and manage services on a local server, showcasing a responsive and dynamic design.

# ⚠️ Note on Backend Requirements

This project includes a PHP and MySQL backend, which means it is not fully functional by simply opening the files in a browser. To run this project properly and enable dynamic features (such as form submissions, login systems, database interactions, etc.), you need a local server environment or a live web hosting server that supports PHP and MySQL.


# ✅ How to Run Locally

To test the full functionality on your local machine:
```
1. Install XAMPP or a similar local server.
```
```
2. Place the project folder inside the htdocs directory.
```
```
3. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.
```
```
4. Import the provided .sql file into phpMyAdmin to set up the database.
```
```
5. Access the project at http://localhost/your-project-folder-name.
```
